## Describe project in 3 sentences?


## Features:
  - Single sign on through company portal
  - Allocation and tracking of budget for employers and employees.
  - Automated booking assistant offered through multiple chat services (Facebook, Slack, ...)

## Proof of concept and demo

During the #bhd we built a proof of concept of how the booking interaction would look through a Facebook chat bot. The interactions are semi-scripted for now but in the long run some natural language interface (through [wit.ai](https://wit.ai) for example) should be implemented.

### How should people use your project?

The available interactions are currently limited. However one can create a Dacebook application through their developer platform and start our bot server to run the proof of concept them.

We provide a video of the current interactions on top of the code for checking it out more easily.

The bot is also live by logging into Facebook on [this page](https://www.facebook.com/Jerry-476947615831987/?__mref=message_bubble)
